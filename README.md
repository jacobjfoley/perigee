# Perigee

Perigee is a near-future space salvage game based on evolutionary algorithms.

## Introduction

As the director of a Perigee space station, you are responsible for clearing up space junk in Earth's lower orbits. To accomplish this, you have a small workshop and hangar bay for drones which can salvage nearby space junk.

Your drones are built using an evolutionary algorithm and will have various strengths and weaknesses in their designs. A drone can be remanufactured in your workshop to split it into several new drones with similar (but not identical) properties. Unwanted drones can be scrapped to free up space in your hangar, while high-performing drones will help work go significantly faster!
